<h2 align="left">About me</h2>

###

<p align="left">I was introduced to programming through Scratch in school. I started creating games there, and over time that hobby got serious, with one of my platformers crossing 100K plays. That feeling of people finding value in something I built made me fall in love with programming. I explored a bit of HTML and CSS, and now, a few years later, I’m studying Computer Science, aiming to become a professional programmer.</p>

###

<p align="left">Outside code, I’m into football tactics and love breaking down Premier League matches. I listen to Punjabi and rap music, and spend a lot of time watching films.</p>

###

<p align="left">My current stack is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’m learning the MERN stack next and plan to dive deeper into data and analytics as my math and programming skills grow.</p>
